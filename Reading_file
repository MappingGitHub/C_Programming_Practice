//Reading_file

/*
feof functions is used to find the end of a file. In a C program, we use feof() function as below.
feof(fp);

where,
fp â€“ file pointer
---------------------------------------------------
In C/C++, getc() returns EOF when end of file is reached. getc() also returns EOF when it fails.
So, only comparing the value returned by getc() with EOF is not sufficient to check for actual
end of file. To solve this problem, C provides feof() which returns non-zero value only if end
of file has reached, otherwise it returns 0.
